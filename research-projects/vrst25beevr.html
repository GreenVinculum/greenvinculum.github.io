      <h2> Abstract </h2>
      <p> Studying bee behavior and diagnosing hive issues in their natural habitats has often been a challenge 
        due to limited visibility, observer interference, and limitations of conventional recording methods. 
        A teleoperated immersive 360$^{\circ}$ view offers an unobstrusive, holistic observation within the hive. 
        In this work, we present a framework for capturing and 
        analyzing bee activity using commercially available 360$^{\circ}$ cameras and 
        hardware to create an immersive VR experience. </p>
